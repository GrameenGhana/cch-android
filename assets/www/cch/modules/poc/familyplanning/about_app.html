        <h1>ACE for Android</h1>
        <p>Copyright 2011 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs</p>
        <p>The ACE mobile app gives family planning providers an easy and effective way to check whether clients are medically eligible to start using certain contraceptive methods. Based on the popular and trusted Family Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers (2011 edition), published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs, ACE reflects the latest family planning guidance from the World Health Organization’s Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use.</p>
        <p>If the client already has a contraceptive method in mind, you can use ACE to check whether she is medically eligible to use her preferred method.</p>
        <p>If the client does not have a method in mind, you can use ACE to find methods for which the client is eligible based on her medical history.</p>
        <p>You can also use ACE to review key characteristics of 20 contraceptive methods, including information about effectiveness, side effects, health benefits, health risks, and how they work.</p>
        <p>Contraceptive methods covered include oral contraceptive pills, injectable contraceptives, the patch, ring, implants, intrauterine devices, male and female sterilization, condoms, and more.</p>
