                        <h2>My Wellness</h2>
                        <p>This content for My Wellness is based on an Indian Medical System which is a qualitative and functional medicine. The medical system states that the physical, physiological and emotional wellbeing are linked and uses qualitative principles such as heavy, cold or dry to describe the functioning of the body and mind.  
 
							The science's approach to wellbeing includes good nutrition, healthy lifestyle habits and a proper outlook in life and utilizes the same qualitative principles to describe food, exercise and other wellness recommendations. "My Wellness" recommendations are designed to help address the health of both the body and mind. Food and exercise, for instance, can help strengthen the body and also change the mood or emotional state.
 
							The science states that different times of the day (circadian clock) affects the body and mind in specific ways. "My Wellness" recommendations written for morning, afternoon or evening factor in these effects of the circadian clock.</p>
