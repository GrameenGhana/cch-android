				<li>Open your mouth and stick your tongue out as much as possible without straining</li>
				<li>Using the head of your toothbrush, gently scrape your tongue from the back of the tongue to the front.</li>
				<li>Scrape the tongue in one continuous motion from back to front</li>
				<li>Do this scraping movement 3 times to remove any coating from the tongue</li>
				<li>You can prevent the gag reflex by not inserting head of the toothbrush too far in your mouth</li>
				<li>Alternatively, you can use your first 3 fingers instead of a toothbrush to scrape your tongue</li>
				<li>After scraping tongue, thoroughly rinse your mouth with water. Spit out all the water.</li>
